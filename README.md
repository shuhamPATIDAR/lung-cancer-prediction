This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of lung cancer based on user responses to specific risk factors. It uses a pre-trained model and a dataset of patient data to provide predictions in a simple, user-friendly format.

Features 🌟
 -> Interactive Form: A user-friendly interface with "Yes" and "No" inputs.
 -> Efficient Prediction: Uses a dataset with 16 features and advanced machine learning techniques for accurate results.
 -> Lightweight Design: Perfect for deployment on a simple web server.
Technology Stack 🛠️
 -> Backend: Python (Flask/Django)
 -> Frontend: HTML, CSS,JS
 -> Machine Learning: Scikit-learn or another ML library
 -> Deployment: Flask Server
Dataset 📊
 -> The dataset contains 250 records with 16 features.
 -> It includes critical risk factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, genetic history, etc.
Usage 🚦
 -> Open the web app.
 -> Answer the form with "Yes" or "No" responses.
 -> Get your lung cancer risk prediction instantly!
Future Enhancements 🔮
 -> Add more features to improve prediction accuracy.
 -> Enable model updates with new datasets.
 -> Support for additional languages.
