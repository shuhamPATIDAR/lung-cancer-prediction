                <h2>What is lung cancer?</h2>
                <p>
                    Lung cancer forms in the lung tissues, often in the cells lining the airways. There are two main types: small cell and non-small cell, with non-small cell being the more common.

                <h2>Symptoms of lung cancer:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>
                    <li>A persistent cough that worsens</li>

                <h2>Who is more likely to develop lung cancer?</h2>
                <p>Anyone can develop lung cancer, but these risk factors raise your chances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Responsible for about 90% of lung cancer cases in men and 80% in women. Quitting reduces risk but does not eliminate it entirely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondhand smoke:</strong> Exposure to smoke from others can increase risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Family history:</strong> A genetic predisposition can increase your chances of developing lung cancer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Workplace exposure:</strong> Exposure to substances like asbestos, arsenic, and chromium raises risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Radiation exposure:</strong> Radiation therapy, radon, or imaging tests like CT scans can contribute to the risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>HIV infection:</strong> Higher risk, possibly due to higher smoking rates in those with HIV.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air pollution:</strong> Living in areas with high pollution levels can also elevate lung cancer risk.</li>
